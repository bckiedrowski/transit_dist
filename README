This repository contains code for the transit-length distribution in binary Markovian media. More specifically, it contains resources to support the following journal publication:

XXXXXXXXXXXX

The repository is organized into four directories:
1) transit_dist contains C++, Python, and Matlab implementations of the function for calculating the transit-length density
2) monte_carlo constains the C++ routine for verifying the transit-length density with a direct sampling approach
3) porous contains all Matlab scripts needed to generate results for light transport through porous media
4) stopping contains all Matlab scripts need to genreate results for charged particle stopping in porous media
